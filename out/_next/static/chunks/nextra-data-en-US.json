But it paid off the last time they made\nthat gamble: we ended up with a little thing called the World Wide Web. Let's\nsee if they can do it again.\n— AaronRead Aaron's original post:\nBuilding Programmable Web Sites by Aaron Swartz, 2009.","quotes-about-www#Quotes About WWW":"“(the Internet) It should be kept open. It should be kept free.” – Steve Jobs\n“The third reason it’s very exciting is that Microsoft doesn’t own it and I\ndon’t think they can. It’s the one thing in the industry that Microsoft can\nprobably never own. I think one of the things that’s essential is that the\ngovernment continue to fund the Internet as a public trust, as a public\nfacility and remove any of these ridiculous notions of privatizing it that\nhave been brought up. I don’t think they’re going to fly, thankfully.” –\nSteve Jobs\nJacques Mattheij wrote an article, about the web in 2050, which feels like\nthe New Speak in George Orwell's 1984.","quotes-from-aarons-post#Quotes from Aaron’s Post":"About API\nAPIs only let you look at the data in a particular way, typically the way\nthat the hosting site looks at it\nAbout API, II (Q: differences between data, protocol, API?)\npass the noun to the verb: /share?v=1234 pass the verb to the noun:\n/v/1234?m=share\nThen he describes the interesting hybrid that the Web adopted, which he terms\n\"Representational State Transfer\" or REST.About “standard” vs “design”\nAnd instead of spending time building things, they've convinced people\ninterested in these ideas that the first thing we need to do is write\nstandards. (To engineers, this is absurd from the start -- standards are\nthings you write after you've got something working, not before!)\nFortunately for us, the Web was designed with this future in mind. The protocols\nthat underpin it are not designed simply to provide pages for human consumption,\nbut also to easily accommodate the menagerie of spiders, bots, and scripts that\nexplore its fertile soil. ...for applications.Then we'll look into what it means for your application to be not just another\ntool for people and software to use, but part of the ecology -- a section of\nthe programmable web. This means exposing your data to be queried and copied and\nintegrated, even without explicit permission, into the larger software\necosystem, while protecting users' freedom.The more likely option is, of course, to break away from the Web altogether, and\nforce people to download special software to use your application. ...
