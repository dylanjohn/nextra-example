one of the most inspiring book about the web, Aaron Swartz&#x27;s A Programmable Web.
And it completely changed my mind.</p>

<p>Sure, it sounds a little bit crazy. But it paid off the last time they made
that gamble: we ended up with a little thing called the World Wide Web. Let&#x27;s
see if they can do it again.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-about-www">Quotes About WWW</h2>
<ol>
<li>“(the Internet) It should be kept open. It should be kept free.” – Steve Jobs</li>
<li>“The third reason it’s very exciting is that Microsoft doesn’t own it and I
don’t think they can. It’s the one thing in the industry that Microsoft can
probably never own. I think one of the things that’s essential is that the
government continue to fund the Internet as a public trust, as a public
facility and remove any of these ridiculous notions of privatizing it that
have been brought up. I don’t think they’re going to fly, thankfully.” –
Steve Jobs</li>
<li>Jacques Mattheij wrote an article, about the web in 2050, which feels like
the <em>New Speak</em> in George Orwell&#x27;s <em>1984</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="quotes-from-aarons-post">Quotes from Aaron’s Post</h2>
<p>About API</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APIs only let you look at the data in a <strong>particular way</strong>, typically the way
that the hosting site looks at it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About API, II (Q: differences between data, protocol, API?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pass the noun to the verb: /share?v=1234 pass the verb to the noun:
/v/1234?m=share</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he describes the interesting hybrid that the Web adopted, which he terms
&quot;Representational State Transfer&quot; or REST.</p>
<p>About “standard” vs “design”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And instead of spending time building things, they&#x27;ve convinced people
interested in these ideas that the first thing we need to do is write
standards. (<strong>To engineers, this is absurd from the start -- standards are
things you write after you&#x27;ve got something working, not before!</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for us, the Web was designed with this future in mind. The protocols
that underpin it are not designed simply to provide pages for human consumption,
but also to easily accommodate the menagerie of spiders, bots, and scripts that
explore its fertile soil. ...for applications.</p>
<p>Then we&#x27;ll look into what it means for your application to be not just another
tool for people and software to use, but <strong>part of the ecology</strong> -- a section of
the programmable web. This means exposing your data to be queried and copied and
integrated, even without explicit permission, into the larger software
ecosystem, while protecting users&#x27; freedom.</p>
<p>The more likely option is, of course, to break away from the Web altogether, and
force people to download special software to use your application. ... If that&#x27;s
a choice you want to make, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be reading this book.</p>
<p>This is one of the secrets of success on the Web: the more you send people away,
the more they come back</p>
<p>About URL and URI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, URLs do not just exist as isolated entities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>URLs shouldn&#x27;t change (and if they do change, the old ones should redirect to
the new ones) so they should only contain information about the page that never
changes. This leads to some obvious requirements.</p>
<p>First, URLs shouldn&#x27;t include technical details of the software you used to
build your website, since that could change at any moment</p>
<p>About TBL</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And even then, they&#x27;re far more limited than the wide-reaching interactivity
that Berners-Lee imagined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, they used the clone created by a team at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), which never supported editing because programmer Marc
Andreesen was too dumb to figure out how to do page editing with inline
pictures, something Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s version had no problem with.</p>
